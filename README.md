Every widget is hidden by a feature gate. This allows you to cherry pick the widgets you actually need.

## Quickstart features

Quickstart features are pretty handy to start and experiment having everything like colors or icons available. Nevertheless, it is recommended to disable these features once the GUI is ready for production and to only include the things you really need.

### Color palette

This crate adds a predefined color palette based on the [CSS color palette](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).

### Bootstrap icons

Thanks to [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com), iced_aw now contains ~1,200 icons to be used in an Iced GUI.

Enable icons with the feature `icons`.

*Note: the icon font with ~1,200 weights around 0.274 MB. This features should only be used for experimenting with all the icons.*
